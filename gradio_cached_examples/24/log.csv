"[[""What are context-free grammars and why are they important in natural language processing?"", ""Context-free grammars are a type of formal grammar in computer science and linguistics where the production rules do not depend on the context in which they are applied. In other words, the meaning of a production rule does not change depending on the symbols that come before or after it in a sentence.\n\nIn natural language processing (NLP), context-free grammars are important because they provide a way to describe the syntactic structure of a language independently of its semantics or meaning. This is useful for tasks such as parsing sentences and generating grammatically correct sentences. Context-free grammars are also used as a foundation for more complex grammar models that take into account semantics and other contextual information.\n\nThe example given in the context is about data types and their relationship to machine learning techniques, and does not directly discuss context-free grammars or their importance in NLP.\n\n Sources: \n\n\n\n1. machine_learning.pdf (page 7) \n\n2. machine_learning.pdf (page 178) ""]]",,,2024-06-28 17:13:54.596564
"[[""How does multiclass classification differ from binary classification?"", ""In multiclass classification, a training example can be labeled with one of several possible labels (k labels in total), while in binary classification, a training example can only be labeled as positive or negative (two labels). The main difference lies in the number and type of labels that can be assigned to a training example.\n\n Sources: \n\n\n\n1. machine_learning.pdf (page 190) \n\n2. machine_learning.pdf (page 10) ""]]",,,2024-06-28 17:13:59.759015
